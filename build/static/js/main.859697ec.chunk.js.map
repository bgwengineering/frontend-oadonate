Bridgewaters Foundation Inc registered in the US and Nigeria, was launched in December 2020.\nOgadonate is a digital marketplace that connects those (individuals corporate or communities) who have needs -personal, \nsocial, or communal, to people ( individual or corporate) who are willing to donate IDLE ITEMS or CASH to meet these needs.\nDonated items are tacked and auctioned through our solution to meet and cash disbursed to the fundraiser accordingly. \nThe marketplace processes not only cash to meet others' needs; our niche is our infrastructure to unlock value values \nfrom waste or idle assets locally or globally.\nIt is the first of its kind seeking to optimize giving and keep account of such social responsibility for future digital \ncurrency reward. \nWe are also able to repair, remodel or refurbish some of these items that would have constituted a nuisance to the environment.\nWhy not do some good here, earn a digital social responsibility currency and boost your individual or corporate CSR brand\n\n\nCASH OR ITEMS, let us provide you the bridge o reach out , give or receive help.\n    </p>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel

 Give or buy for the price of 3, yes Three!\nJoy, value for money spent and openness are rare to come by in the marketplace.\nThe possibilities we make happen are not about us but about the difference you love to make happen. \nOgaDonate empowers you or your business to give cash or buy an idle item to effect the change you care about.\n\nThere is so much an individual can do to affect a change and in the absence of cash, you can give an item to support a cause, collaborating with others to make a huge/profound difference you alone could not have made. At OGADONATE we don’t just connect you to the cause that matters, we empower those with verified needs or causes: preventive or curative; we provide you with feedback information on how your giving is utilized. And when you buy from the platform, you are not just buying at the most affordable price anywhere but you are helping someone meet a need or advance a cause.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel value={value} index={2}>\n      <div className=\"d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center\">\n        <div className=\"col-lg-8\">\n        <p className=\"ogadonate-text\">\n        In the age of growing economic challenges, cash donations are dwindling.\n        But Ogadonate offers you a meeting place and resources to pitch your need to people, businesses and\n        firms and at the same time realize cash from those items the way and\n         manner no one else allows.<br /> All logistics and worries are taking off you.\n      Simply upload a need, we verify, you share and we promote.
