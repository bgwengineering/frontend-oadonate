      According to a 2020 report by the U.N. Development Program. About 1.3 Billion people in 107 developing countries are multidimensionally poor: yet, some percentage of the population have a resource or items they consider idle but can still be of great value to others.

At OgaDonate, we provide rare linkage for the re-allocation of cash or item, from those who care about others in need to those who need a hand; matching these deficits with the surplus economy. 

We work to eliminate waste, by linking an individual or organizations who want to get rid of an item considered old or no longer needed by the owner to someone who would derive value from such items.
